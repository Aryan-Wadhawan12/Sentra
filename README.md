Here’s your content structured into a professional Project Plan format for Sentra™ — Ethical Facial Recognition for Homes and Schools:

Sentra™ Project Plan: Ethical Facial Recognition for Secure Spaces

1. Project Vision & Objectives
Purpose:
 Develop a secure and ethical facial recognition system focused on access control, privacy, and automation for home and school environments.
Goal:
 Design a reliable, privacy-first system enabling:
Automated attendance in schools


Secure access to homes


Ethically managed and locally stored facial data



2. Project Scope
Included:
Hardware and software for facial recognition


Integration with smart locks and motion sensors


Attendance dashboard for schools


Mobile and web-based admin interfaces


Local-only data storage with AES-256 encryption


Excluded:
Cloud-based storage or processing


Enterprise-scale deployments (initial version)



3. System Components
A. Hardware
Camera Module: Raspberry Pi Camera or Logitech C920 (high-res support)


Processing Unit: Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, or Jetson Xavier (for higher performance)


Locking System: Smart locks (e.g., August, Yale) integrated with facial access


Optional Sensors: Motion detection for automation and alerts


B. Software
Facial Recognition: OpenCV, Dlib; optionally TensorFlow/PyTorch for custom models


Backend: Python with Flask/FastAPI


Database: SQLite or MySQL (local-only)


User Interface:


Web dashboard for admin control (parents, staff)


Optional mobile app for remote alerts/control


Security:


AES-256 data encryption


Data anonymization and opt-out options



4. Key Workflows
A. Facial Enrollment
Admin captures user photo


Data processed and stored securely on device


B. Home Access Control
Face scanned at door


Recognized: Door unlocks, sends notification


Unrecognized: Alert sent to admin, access denied


C. School Attendance System
Facial scan on classroom/school entry


Auto-logging of attendance


Dashboard for live status, alerts for absences/tardiness



5. Privacy & Ethical Framework
Consent First: Obtain explicit consent for enrollment


Data Control: Local-only storage, no cloud dependency


Bias Reduction: Use diverse datasets to reduce algorithmic bias


User Rights: Opt-out option and complete data deletion support



6. Project Phases & Timeline
Phase
Duration
Key Deliverables
1. Research & Planning

8. Risks & Mitigations
Risk
Mitigation Strategy
Facial accuracy in poor lighting
Calibrate cameras; implement IR/night-vision tech
Hardware-software integration delays
Use standardized modules with thorough documentation
User mistrust
Clear, transparent privacy policies and consent UI


9. Unique Value Proposition: Why Sentra™?
